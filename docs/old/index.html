      <em>elm-widgets</em> is a front-end library for <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">elm</a>
      based on <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-css/latest">elm-css</a>.
      It ships with prebuilt views focusing in accessibility and customization.
      </p>

      <p>
      This project can be compared to other front-end frameworks like
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>,
      <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>, or in elm,
      <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/latest">Style-Elements</a>.
      There are implementation differences between Bootstrap and Bulma, these
      are CSS and/or Javascript frameworks meanwhile elm-widgets only targets
      elm. By the other hand, Style-Elements implements its own. There are
      also design differences. Not an style/css framework, focusing html and
      aria (links here). is not focused on style. It can also be compared
      with Style-Elements, but its foundations is css and does not tries to
      hide it to you.
      </p>

      <p>
      There is no fancy theming or style in base library. A minimalistic theme
      is provided by X. We use this library through this examples to show how
      themed components can look.
      </p>

      <h2>A Quick Tour</h2>

      <p>
      Before starting, a knowledge of elm and elm-css is assumed.
      </p>

      <h3>Browser Rendering Differences</h3>

      <p>
      Not all browser renders the same elements in the same way. To solve
      this common pain, elm-widgets ships with its own normalization styles.
      Its based on normalize.css 8.0.0 and it's totally optional.
      </p>

      <p>
      Is recommended to use it, but any other normalization library should
      get the work done. You can include it in your project using `xxx` which
      is a elm-css snippet.
      </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint lang-haskell">
import Css.Foreign
import Html.Styled as Html exposing (Html)
import TODO.Base.Normalize as Normalize

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  Html.div
      []
      [ Css.Foreign.global Normalize.snippets
      , ...
      ]</pre>

      <p>
      elm-widgets is all about common reusable views. Inputs are usually the
      view that required a little more of work and can, so making them reusable
      save us time.
